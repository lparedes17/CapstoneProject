My Capstone Project

You must open in the terminal in the client directory and type in **npm start** 
Same goes for the server directory, open terminal and type **node server.js**  for backend to work with the frontend. 

If there you type **node server.js** and there is no line saying "*MongoDB database connection established successfully*", 
then you must download MongoDB Community Server. It is done locally so you must download:

[link](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

Make sure you add it in the PATH enviroment variable. You will need to open the Mongo shell to create database. 

You create **/data/db** in C drive and open the terminal at this location and type in **mongo**

Then open another terminal and type to same location (c:/data/db) and type in mongod to check if the connection is established.
